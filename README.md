ArtFlow – Digital Art Commissioning Platform

Problem Statement

Independent digital artists and clients commonly rely on social media platforms for handling art commissions. This results in unstructured communication, unclear requirements, delayed responses, and difficulty in tracking project progress. The absence of a dedicated system makes professional commission management inefficient and unreliable.

Solution Implemented

ArtFlow is a full-stack digital art commissioning platform developed using the MERN stack with Socket.IO for real-time communication. The platform provides secure user authentication and role-based access for artists and clients. Clients can create commission requests, while artists can manage assigned projects. A real-time chat feature enables clear and instant communication within each project, reducing misunderstandings and improving workflow. The backend manages data securely, and the React frontend ensures a smooth user experience.

Current Status

The core functionalities, including authentication, project creation, real-time messaging, and backend–frontend integration, are fully implemented and working correctly on a fixed backend server.

Future Plans

Planned enhancements include secure payment integration, collaborative tools such as shared workspaces, improved artist search and filtering, and cloud-based storage for final artwork delivery.
